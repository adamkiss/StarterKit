# Notes

These are my notes, so I know.

## TODO

- download minified jquery, modernizr.
	- consider submoduling it?
	- maybe something else (modernizr has custom builds)
- start building some lib-partials to reuse (maybe steal something from Bootstrap/Foundation?)
- update Bourbon/Neat
	- or remove it entirely
- create project checklist, because you know you forget a lot of things, often
- check whether the analytics code is ok

### Changelog

**11-05-2014**
Finally, removed all old shit, and replaced it with my new shiny Gulpfile! Woohoo.
