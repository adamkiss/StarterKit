# Notes

These are my notes, so I know.

## TODO

- download minified jquery, modernizr.
	- consider submoduling it?
	- maybe something else (modernizr has custom builds)
- start building some lib-partials to reuse (maybe steal something from Bootstrap/Foundation?)
- create project checklist, because you know you forget a lot of things, often
- check whether the analytics code is ok

### Changelog

**24-02-2015**
Removed Bourbon/Neat, replaced it with the Include Media and stole Clearfix from Bourbon. Simplified screen.css (added Category headings for future references). Removed unneeded `lib/_libs.scss` (four library files used, remember?).

**11-05-2014**
Finally, removed all old shit, and replaced it with my new shiny Gulpfile! Woohoo.
