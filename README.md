# StarterKit v0.2

## Description

Our very own HTML/CSS starter kit/framework, with default HTML/HAML and some nice CSS defaults.

## Another one?

Here at Bonetics, we like smarter work. We also like frameworks, having great deal of funcionality you do often. However, our defaults seem to be really different from standard defaults found in Bootstrap, or Foundation. We also tend to need greater need of how variable things need to be. So, here it is: predefined parts for things that ought to be done good once with minor changes, and helpful helpers (yay!) for things that ought to be site-specific.

## How to use

### Sinatra/Rails app

1. Add following gems:

   ```
    gem "bourbon"
   ```
1. Copy StarterKit into your project
1. Use & profit

### Compiling with CodeKit v1.3.5+

1. Copy StarterKit into your project
1. Add project to CodeKit
1. Set your project to use Bourbon
1. Compile & profit

*Note: using this starter kit leads to profit anyway.*
