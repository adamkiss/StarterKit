# StarterKit

My very own setup for most of front-end/designy stuff I work on. I use mostly the same stuff over & over — save for big jumps like when I went from Less to Sass — but when I change something in specific projects, I don't save it anywhere 'general'.

And then, when I start new project, I end up searching through all of the recent projects/hacks… "I knew I fixed this somewhere".

This is my latest try to have some central repo with up-to-date stuff I use.

## The story

We started this repository with [Matej](http://hrescak.com/) some time in 2012, because of the very same reasons why it exists right now, but then it kind of died, because we moved on to other languages and other jobs as well.

I find myself in position of needing it again.

## Notes

These notes are mostly for myself, so when I get to this project weeks, months or even years later down the line, I know what is here.
