# StarterKit

My very own setup for most of front-end/designy stuff I work on.

## The story

We started this repository with [Matej](http://hrescak.com/) some time in 2012, because of the very same reasons why it exists right now, but then it kind of died, because we moved on to other languages and other jobs as well.

I need it again, because my workflow ~~sucks~~ sucked. I just (5.11.2014) finished my first gulpfile.

## Notes

This is for myself, mostly.

### Assets

1. Install Node.js (brew)
2. Install npm (Node.js)
3. Install all required modules (I should probably automate this part. Oh well)

#### When starting new project
1. Copy to your project
2. Run `sh /Assets/src/npmlinkmodules.sh`. It will link global `npm` modules (ha!)
3. Edit gulp (probably BrowserSync proxy and Build Version File only)
4. Do awesome shit.
